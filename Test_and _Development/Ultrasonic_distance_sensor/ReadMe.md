# Testing an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
This is a simple test of an ultrasonic distance sensor connected to an Arduino Uno.  The .ino
software file is included and the comments in this source code file show how to hook up the
ultrasonic sensor to the Uno.  The code and hardware connections were copied from an online source.  
Compile and upload the source code file to the Uno using the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.7 was used 
for this test). Use the serial monitor to display the distance of an object (such as a book) held in 
front of the ultrasonic sensor.
