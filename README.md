Hardware, firmware, software and documentation for robot development using Arduino and AI2.

NOTE: the current version of firmware and the app support manual and autonomous operation of the robot.  The current version of the robot uses three ultrasonic sensors.  The main sensor is mounted forward facing.  Testing has established that the best way for the robot to search for an open pathway is to pivot and take distance measurements forward.  When the robot encounters an obstacle in front of its travel, it stops, randomly selects to search right or left, and then pivots in the selected direction repeatedly until it either measures an open path forward or maxes out on the number of allowed pivots.  In the latter case, the robot stops and reverts to the manual made of operation.

Testing has found that the robot does not always travel a straight path when commanded to do so (both motors at the same speed and direction).  There are various reasons for this issue.  The main issue is the front pivot caster getting stuck.  However, traction issues on the wheels can also cause this problem.  Two more ultrasonic rangefinder sensors are used to detect when the robot is too close to a wall on one side and if so, the robot pivots in the opposite direction until the way is clear.  Mounting the side sensors at a 45 degree angle between side and forward seems to work well for avoiding the robot hitting a side wall at an oblique angle.
