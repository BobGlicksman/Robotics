# Robotics
Hardware, firmware, software and documentation for robot development using Arduino and AI2.

NOTE: the released version of the firmware and the app now supports a very limited autonomous mode.  When “AUTO” is selected from the app, the robot will move forward at low spped and stop when it detects an obstacle approximately 8 inches in front of it.  When stopped, the robot reverts to the manual (app command) mode.  The next step is to add in autonomous mode firmware to have the robot scan left and right to find an open place to turn to when an obstacle is encountered in front of it.
